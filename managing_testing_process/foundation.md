Tools you need to build testing:
1. Risk analysis. Sequencing your tests to find bugs. Test triage. Risk based testing.
2. Test plan. Such a plan addresses the issues of scope, quality risk management, test strategy, staffing, resources,
hardware logistics, configuration management, scheduling, phases, major milestones and phase transitions, and budgeting.
3. Well-engineered test system. Good test systems build confidence when the tests pass, produce credible, useful,
timely information, have internal and external consistency, are easy to learn and use, and build on a set of well-behaved
and compatible tools.
4. Bug tracking database.
5. Comprehensive test-tracking spreadsheet. We need to follow the status of each test case, and have statistics, history,
trends, logs.
6. A simple change management database. Place where you track all not-code-related delays of the functionality delivery.
7. A solid business case for testing. Analyze the testing return on investment, based on solid, well established quality
management techniques.

The Resources You Need:
1. A practical test lab with equipment.
2. Test engineers and technicians.
3. Contractors and consultants. 
4. External test labs, testing services providers, and vendors.
