# Test System Architecture, Cases, and Coverage

## Test System Architecture and Engineering
By test system, I mean the organizational capability for testing created by the testing processes, the testware, 
and the test environment. \
- The testing processes include both written and unwritten procedures, checklists, and other agreements about the way the
  test team does its testing.
- The testware includes all those tools, documents, scripts, data, cases, tracking mechanisms, and so forth that the test
  team uses to do its testing. 
- The test environment includes the hardware, software, networking and other infrastructure, paper and other supplies,
  facilities, lab, and so forth that the test team procures, installs, and configures the system under test in order to
  test it.

A good test system helps the tester focus his testing efforts on the key quality risks, and find, reproduce, isolate,
describe, and manage the most important bugs in the software or hardware being tested, as well as capturing and analyzing
key metrics.

The *test mission* or test policy is a document that defines the goals of testing. For example, do the goals of testing
include finding defects? Building confidence? Reducing risk? In addition to these goals, the key process indicators or
metrics are defined for determining whether the test team is meeting the goals. The *test strategy* document tells how
— in a project-independent way — to go about fulfilling the goals. The *test plan* implements the test strategy in a way
that fits the project and that achieves the mission as appropriate to the project. The *test architecture* implements the
test strategy in a way that defines how the testware supports the guiding principles of testing in the test strategy.
